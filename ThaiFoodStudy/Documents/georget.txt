3star

Word on the street was that Thailand Cafe got an awesome Szechuan
chef, so I wanted to give it a shot.  I had to ask specifically for
the Szechuan menu after getting the Thai menu, but the host was really
nice about it.  He suggested several dishes to try and I ended up with
a beef/cabbage dish served with a side of rice.  The spice on the beef
instantly made my tongue feel tingly (that's the best way to describe
it).  The host came over and explained that the tingly feeling is
perfectly normal for the dish.  Unfortunately, after that I couldn't
taste anything at all.  The beef and cabbage tasted bland even though
they were coated in chili oil.  The dish was a 3 pepper dish (the
highest on their spice scale), but it didn't seem hot at all.  I would
give them two stars for the food, but the host was so nice, so three
stars seems appropriate.
