If you take this restaurant out of the 'authentic Thai food' category
it has pretty decent food.  

I'm bonkers for the Excited Chicken and a true fan of their Scallion
Pancakes + sauce.  It's not that expensive which is good too.

A few negative marks come from it's acoustic flaws and somewhat
lackadaisical wait staff.  You can pretty much be heard from across
the room if you're not talking at the level of a whisper and good luck
prying the staff away from their laptop video games... I'm an MIT
student so I understand video game obsessions (my profile anyone?) but
not while I'm trying to get the bill paid to rush off to class!  

I'm still eating there so something has to be worth it right?  3 stars.
