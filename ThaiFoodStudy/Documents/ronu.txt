If you're living near MIT and you need Thai pick-up that's walkable,
then maybe this is a good option. I'd already discounted my opinion
given they do mostly take-out, but I was still disappointed. Noodle
dishes are all a bit watery, flavor is just so-so, and thai iced tea
was watered down. I gave the usual 'khap khun krap' to say thank you
in Thai, but the owners and wait staff just stared blankly. Seriously,
if you're going to run a Thai restaurant, at least understand 'hello'
and 'thank you.'
