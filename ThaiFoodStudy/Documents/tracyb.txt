4star

I dont even remember the first time I came here or who introduced me
too it... But it was Love... But from reading all the other reviews
just now, I think I havent been eating real Thai all along & now Im
disappointed... The place is a little small & the service isnt always
the best, but for what you pay & portions you can beat it... The Pad
Thai is like someone else noted, Not the worst I have had... They use
the freshest vegetables in most dishes which does make a big
difference. I would recommend the Beef Macadamia - I am addicted &
would recommend if in Central Square looking for something to eat...
