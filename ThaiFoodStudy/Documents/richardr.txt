4star

Very good Chinese food.  I'm thinking 4+ here.

Dan Dan Noodles:  Good.  I liked this dish better than Mary Chung's.
Maybe MC was having a bad day when I was there.

Sichaun Wantons (or dumplings??) in Capsicum vinaigrette:  Very Good.
Spicy with great flavor.

Braised Eggplant:  Very Good. Just finished the leftovers for lunch
today.  Just as good the second day.

Sweet Potato Noodles with Ground Pork:  Very Good.  This is the well
known Sichuan dish "Ant's Clime a Tree".

Two Thumbs up.  Prices are decent.  I'm not sure I heard  any English
spoken on my last trip (all Chinese).  I will be checking out more of
the Chinese menu.
