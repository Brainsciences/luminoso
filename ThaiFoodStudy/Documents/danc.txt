I use to go to this place quite often when I was in college.  I also
use to share a shower with a bunch of gross guys and would drink warm
Natty Ice in college, so just keep that in mind.  I recently went back
after a year or two away (and in that time visiting multiple other
Thai places) and I have to say I wasn't particularly impressed.
Though the place is small and austere, it is usually more or less
empty so there is always a spot.  You can also get take out or
delivery fairly quick, which is a big plus.  For some reason it took
longer for us to get our food while dining in than it takes to have it
made and delivered.

The food is cheap and pretty consistent with lunch specials at about
$7 (add $1.25 for a little app to go with it).  My favorites are the
drunken noodle and the pad thai.  On occasion the pad thai tastes a
little like cat, I'm really not sure how else to put it, it is like
they have special cat bullion cubes they add whenever I ask for it
spicy.  Also the sweet and sour sauce is a little strange, not the
neon pink goo that we are all use to.  The scallion pancake was a
little too crispy, resembling more of pita chip than the greasy,
doughy treat it usually is.

Bottom Line: Average Thai place.  I wouldn't travel far for it, but if
you are in the area you could do a whole lot worse.
