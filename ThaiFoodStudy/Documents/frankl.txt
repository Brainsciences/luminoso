This place was my introduction to Thai food sadly.  The food is
edible, but I would hardly call it Thai.  The food here is so far from
authentic Thai that I think it's really just in a category of their
own, and not in a good way.

Like others have noted.  Pad Thai is a metric to for the Thai
restaurant and Thailand Cafe fails miserably.  Sad, white, soupy,
bland, and not-peanuty-enough are some ways you can describe it.

Are there any Thai people in the kitchen???

I think Thailand is embarrassed to be associated to this place.  So I
vote to change the name to T- - -land Cafe.  

Craving Thai food?  Try Similans, Brown Sugar or even Pepper Sky, trip
worth making even if you live next door at MIT's Random Hall.
