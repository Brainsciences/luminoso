I singularly love this place to death  The dishes are incredibly good
for the price; I especially like the green curry, as well as any of
their duck dishes.  And the service is polite, and the waiters haven't
killed me yet.  

You see, I used to spend a lot of time at Random Hall, which is the
MIT dorm right next door, and I would get always get a hankering for
Thai Ice Tea right around closing time for them.  I'd go to Thai Cafe
and just sit there and order three Thai Ice teas, and slowly drink
them, and just about drive the waiters insane, I think.  But they
never denied me my sugary tea, and for that I'm appreciative.
