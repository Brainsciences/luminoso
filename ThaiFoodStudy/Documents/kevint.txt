Uhhhh....where was the Thai food??? I was told that this place served
a combination of Thai and Schezuan food but everything on the menu was
straight up schezuan food, which wasn't even that spicy! This place
was actually really crowded tonight and I had high expectations but I
found myself extremely disappointed. It didn't help that it took
forever for our food to come.

The first dish that arrived was the braised fish in spicy sauce. Not
only was the sauce not spicy, but the fish had hella bones which made
it really annoying to eat. The flavor wasn't that great either. The
dry chicken entree we had was actually decent but wasn't great. We
also ordered eggplants with garlic sauce and this was decent as well.
My only complaint is that they drenched it in sauce, which can't be
that great for you. I've had much better Schezuan food back in San
Diego....this place can't even compare. And again, where was the Thai
food?
