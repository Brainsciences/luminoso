Don't get what the fuss is all about.....mostly MIT students like
this.  But people, there are lots of Thai in  Boston outside of the
area that's way better!!  Not worth all those rants and raves.   Its
decent and cheap, but  Cheap Thai food is done much better at Rod
Dee's (Brookline and Peterborough St) and hello BROWN SUGAR (lunch
menu is cheap).  See there is life outside of the MIT campus.
