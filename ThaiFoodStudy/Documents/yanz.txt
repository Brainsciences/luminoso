Their new Sichuan menu is a revelation unto the wasteland of vaguely
Asian food that was Thailand Cafe a few months ago. After lunch today,
my impression of Thailand Cafe has been born anew, baptized in a bath
of chili oil and peppercorns. Skip the anemic curries; go straight for
the beef and tongue tripe topped with ground peanuts* or the tender,
spice-encrusted cumin-braised beef.    

*Better known as fūqī fèipiàn to well-versed in the unsexy intricacies
of Chinese offal.

Capsaicin runs in my veins, so I'm bound to complain that Thailand
Cafe still has ample room to kick up the spice levels. In particular,
I'm used to a much more salty, tongue-numbing rendition of tripe.
Nonetheless, Thailand Cafe makes a good effort: thinly sliced and
tender if not as tongue-teasingly textured as other versions, and
savory enough to be addictive. Four stars to the new chef for having
the guts to dish out Sichuan cuisine that makes me forget I'm at
Thailand Cafe.
