This is one of the only Thai places near work. My co-workers and I
come here every once in a while when all the other restaurant options
have been exhausted. Today we got the Crazy Noodle and Thai Fried
Rice. It comes with a bland, spicy soup and a choice of appetizer. I
got the chicken satay which was quite dry. The Crazy Noodle was
palatable.

I prefer Brown Sugar or Pepper Sky over this
