This is a Thai food restaurant that is run by Chinese people (I know
because I am Chinese and I can understand what they're saying). The
food is not too bad, though I suspect not terribly authentic. It's
relatively cheap, and the quality is decent, though the dishes are not
big in quantity. I've been there so many times that I feel their menu
is pretty limited. However, I do recommend their seafood noodle.
Overall, this is a reasonable place to pick up a nice quick meal for a
reasonable price.
