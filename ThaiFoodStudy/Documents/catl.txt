3star

This small spot is a a bit of a hidden gem.  It is not a place you would even think to go into unless someone told you it was "ok" as the curb appeal leaves a bit to be desired.  The food is quick and flavorful.  It is hard to find a table during a weekday lunch as it is a popular spot among many local workers.  It is much quieter at dinner because it does not have a dinner ambiance.  Service is quick!
