5star

Delicious Thai food, best ever for the price.  They have a great
vegetarian selection, and will make almost anything vegetarian if you
ask them.  The wait staff is attentive, and we've never had to wait
more than 10 minutes for our food to come out of the kitchen.  I love
their Thai sticks (veggie tempura-style appetizer), and their tofu
triangles are hot and fresh.  I miss this place so much!
