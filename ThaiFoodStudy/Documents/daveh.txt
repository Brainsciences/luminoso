3star

Thailand Cafe has a plain interior, and isn't overly large. There are
separate bathrooms for women and men with a shared sink between. It
was late so our party of six was seated quickly.

We ordered the "spicy" noodles (read: lo mein!), two curries dishes
(watery consistency but tasty), seafood dish that was scrumptious, and
a serving of sesame chicken, which was easily the best thing we had -
and not Thai! None of the dishes were spicy, sadly.

We stuffed ourselves. (Good thing too, since we needed food to absorb
the alcohol we would consume in about an hour near Fenway Park.)

Service was fast, which may have had a little to do with the fact that
it was practically abandoned when we went, that is, on a late night
and right before summer session. Our server (Sonia?) brought out items
when needed.

Thailand Cafe proudly declares "Authentic Thai cuisine" on their
business card. Not sure about AUTHENTIC (the cafe is probably run by
Chinese), but it's cheap food, they have catering and take out
available, and even deliver (after 5 PM)! Top that with the fact that
they are conveniently near MIT dorms and open seven days a week for
lunch and dinner, and you see why they're still in business.

If you're visiting from out of town, avoid. If you go to school
nearby, you will probably end up going here no matter what this
Pennsylvanian says.
