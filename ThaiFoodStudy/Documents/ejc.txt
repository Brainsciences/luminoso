Go elsewhere for Thai. We ordered takeout. I'd describe what we got as
old shrimp floating in a watery sauce with some uncooked vegetables;
their "satay" was bizarrely fried rather than grilled. Both chicken
and frying oil were, I suspect, like the shrimp, old. An entree and
two appetizers cost $23.00. I'm assuming they need to charge so much
because no one ever goes to this place more than once. Not Thai, not
good, not worth your money.
