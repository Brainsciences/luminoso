No, I don't understand what this place has to do with Thailand, but
the Sichuan food they serve is fantastic.

So - shopping at the Korean market - question arises - where to have
lunch. Honey says: "Let's go to Thailand Cafe across the street." I
say: Thailand and Sichuan cuisine? You must be out of your mind. If
they cannot make up their mind, how can the food be any good? Uhhh was
I wrong.

Ignore the Thailand signage and decor if you like really good Sichuan
food. Chengdu spicy chicken, beef jerky (added 3 orders for take out -
not kidding), dan dan mien and a cold cucumber dish were all
fantastic. Two weeks earlier I was in Chengdu and I must attest, the
food at Thailand Cafe could not have been more authentic Sichuan. It
rivals the classics in the suburbs (Sichuan Gourmet and Sichuan Garden).

Decor and service spoil the experience a little, but the food was
outstanding. I definitely will go again ...
