1star

Start with wine that tasted like vinegar, tom yum goong that tasted
worse than dishwater, fried chicken satay that was dried out, a red
chicken curry that was just lame and a spicy tofu dish that was
marinated in MSG.

No doubt the restaurant is cheap, but you might as well hit the mini
mart on the corner and zap some burritos in the microwave.
