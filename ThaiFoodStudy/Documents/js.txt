Great SCHEZUAN FOOD.  Don't let the reviews for the Thai food take
this place down, this place has some of the best authentic chinese
food in cambridge.  This place deserves a clean slate since they
changed management/chef.  It has transformed my opinion of them from 1
star to 5!  

Here are some recommendations:
1. Towel Gourd - Sounds strange, but it's just a juicy green vegetable
in a yummy garlic sauce.  Perfect non greasy compliment to the rest of
the dishes you'll get.
2.  Pork in garlic sauce - Slices of pork with veggies in a tangy,
mildly spicy sauce. One of my favorites here.
3. Cold Beef tongue, tripe and meat - Very spicey and sliced into thin
pieces that counteract the normally chewy texture of tripe.  Not a big
fan of tripe normally but this dish hits the spot.
4.  Tofu with ground pork (not sure how exactly they translate it, but
just ask for Mabo Dofu) -  Spicy and oily tofu with ground pork and
green scallions!  Done really well here and perfect to order with rice.
5.  Pork belly with chestnuts -  Very tender pork belly pieces with
roasted chestnuts.  Deliciousness may be directly proportional to how
fatty the pieces of meat are!

will update more as i go there more often.  Great find and especially
a favorite for being so close to MIT!
