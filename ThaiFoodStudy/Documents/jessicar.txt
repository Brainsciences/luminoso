Thailand Cafe is beloved by MIT students for being cheap and tasty.
It has pretty good vegetarian options and is great place to go for a
quick lunch.  Try the scallion pancakes.

ooh and they have Ginger Ale and this weird toothpick dispenser that
is essentially a plastic bird serving you a wooden stick.

(not the best thai in cambridge by a long shot but the most convenient
for a quick bite if you are at MIT)
