You ever get that 'not-so-fresh' feeling?

This is the type of place where you realize you've been taking for
granted the other places you're used to regularly eating. The Thai
food here was SOOOOOO bad, that I now appreciate every other place
I've been to, even the not-so-great places in the Back Bay.

Satay. How do you go wrong with this? Tasted like dried beef jerky in
teriyaki sauce, that they submerged in a cup of water for about an
hour to re-hydrate it, then ram a stick through it and 'hey presto'...
satay.

Oh... and the 'peanut' sauce..... ugh..... curry-flavored diahrea..
like that mug of fat bastard's bowel collection that Austin Powers
drank thinking it was coffee.

We had the Pad See Yoo (and yes, SEE YOU LAYTAH).... AWFUL. The
broccoli looked like LAST week's reject that even the dog didn't want
to piss on.

The noodles tasted like something out of a can..... of fecal waste.

The place is awful. I don't think I've ever yelped about anything as
bad as this, and I just want this stuff to pass through my system so
that I can examine the nuclear waste that pops out.

FAIL.
