I used to live next door to Thailand Cafe and it was great having this
great cheap Thai food just downstairs.  They're very fast and their
massaman curry is really good and I love their peanut sauce. Their
appetizers are great.  Brown Sugar has better food but is really in a
different class and not comparable.
