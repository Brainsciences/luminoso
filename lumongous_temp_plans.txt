What is the input to eigenvector_iteration?

- A mapping from _id to total. Simple enough.
- But, where does the initial mapping come from?
- Two simple possibilities:
    - Start with the total (minus other eigenvector components)
    - Start with a semi-arbitrary single entry (should be efficient!)
- This can be specified from Python

How can eigenvector_iteration take previous eigenvectors into account?
    - What we need is a "normalize" function that includes orthogonality.
    - For each eigenvector:
        - Accumulate a dot product of the result with the eigenvector
        - Subtract the eigenvector times that dot product
        - Accumulate a dot product of the result with itself
        - If 0, bail out
        - Divide by the square root of that product
