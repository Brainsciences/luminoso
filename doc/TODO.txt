Current bugs and future plans
=============================

Simple things to fix
--------------------
- If you choose an axis, rotate slightly so that the axis remains selected, and
  choose the same axis again, nothing happens. (It should put the axis back
  where it was before the rotation.)
- Support encoding detection with the 'chardet' module throughout, not just in
  Study.analyze().

Harder things to fix
--------------------
- Make it multilingual -- don't assume English.
- Study loading is inexplicably slow (loading the pickles individually doesn't
  take that long).
- Unexpected data leads to less-than-helpful error messages.

Long-term features
------------------

- Ability to turn on and off the display of different blend matrices [hard]
- Ability to load a single matrix without wrapping it in a study?
- Ability to use CCIPCA, include streaming data in a study
- Toggle between projecting the SVD like we do now, and MDSing it
- Clusters (giving them descriptions)
