Current bugs and future plans
=============================

Simple things to fix
--------------------
- If you choose an axis, rotate slightly so that the axis remains selected, and
  choose the same axis again, nothing happens. (It should put the axis back
  where it was before the rotation.)

Harder things to fix
--------------------
- Make it multilingual -- don't assume English.
- Study loading is inexplicably slow (loading the pickles individually doesn't
  take that long).
- Unexpected data leads to less-than-helpful error messages.

Long-term features
------------------

- Ability to turn on and off the display of different blend matrices [hard]
- Ability to load a single matrix without wrapping it in a study?
- Ability to use CCIPCA, include streaming data in a study
- Toggle between projecting the SVD like we do now, and MDSing it
- Clusters (giving them descriptions)

Big huge text processing redesign (Feb 2011)
--------------------------------------------
- Use NLTK (embedded in the module?) to extract unigrams/bigrams with TF-IDF
- Filter to informative features, to get documents x (concepts + other
  features)
- Blend with spectral assoc of ConceptNet
- Special types of input:
    - Canonicals: meaningful values in the space of possible documents
    - Labels: key=value or key=??? pairs, representing information we may or
      may not know about the document
- Labels and canonicals are categories projected into the space, not used to
  form the space
- Use SVC to determine unknown labels
- Use K-means to discover new categories
